Dev Journal — 2025-08-15 — Initial Scaffold
========================================

Commit:
  SHA: <to be determined>
  Author: You
  Date/Time (ET): 2025-08-15
  Branch: main

Summary:
  - Added monorepo skeleton, Dev Journal system (local reminder + CI enforcement), FastAPI MVP stubs, Next.js public pages, SQL schema draft.

Decision Log:
  - Start with non-breaking API stubs (DEV_SKIP_AUTH) to avoid blocking UI.
  - CI enforces Journal on main; local hook is a reminder (non-blocking).

Files/Paths:
  - SETUP_00_README.txt
  - .gitignore
  - docs/journal/_template.txt
  - docs/journal/README.md.txt
  - .githooks/commit-msg
  - scripts/install-hooks.sh

  - api/app/main.py, api/requirements.txt, api/.env.example
  - web/.env.local.example
  - web/src/app/(page.tsx, track-record/page.tsx, accuracy/page.tsx, dashboard/page.tsx, parlay/page.tsx)
  - web/src/lib/api.ts

API Changes:
  - Added endpoints:
    GET /health
    GET /v1/predictions/history (public, stub)
    GET /v1/accuracy (public, stub)
    GET /v1/predictions/today (paid, stub; gated by require_auth that can be bypassed in dev)
    POST /v1/parlays/evaluate (paid; EV calculator)

Data Model / Migrations:
  - Introduced core tables; prediction_archive is append-only via trigger.
  - Hash-chain field exists but computed by backend later.

Env/Secrets:
  - api/.env: DEV_SKIP_AUTH, CORS, DATABASE_URL (optional), STRIPE keys.

Backward compatibility:
  - [x] No breaking changes (MVP stubs).

Test Plan:
  - Built and ran API (uvicorn) with DEV_SKIP_AUTH=true.
  - Next.js pages fetch stub endpoints successfully.

Deployment steps:
  1) Push repo; configure Vercel (web) & Railway/Render (api).
  2) Set env vars in each platform.
  3) Apply SQL to managed Postgres (if using cloud DB).

Rollback:
  - git revert <sha> or redeploy previous tag.

Next Steps:
  - Implement real DB layer (SQLAlchemy) and wire history/accuracy from DB.
  - Add auth (Supabase/NextAuth) + Stripe checkout endpoints.
  - Replace stubs with model publisher + outcomes ingestor.

Open Questions:
  - Choose DB host (Supabase vs Railway vs RDS)?
  - Pick Auth provider (Supabase Auth vs NextAuth)?
