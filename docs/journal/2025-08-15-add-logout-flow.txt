Dev Journal — 2025-08-15 — Add sign-out flow
Summary:
- Added logout() helper that clears JWT from localStorage.
- Added /logout page that clears token on mount and redirects to /login.
- Added SignOutButton component for use in headers or account page.

Files:
- web/src/lib/api.ts
- web/src/app/logout/page.tsx
- web/src/components/SignOutButton.tsx

How to test:
- Visit /logout directly or place <SignOutButton/> in your header.
- After sign-out, navigating to /dashboard or /parlay should redirect to /login, then show upgrade CTA post-login if not subscribed.
