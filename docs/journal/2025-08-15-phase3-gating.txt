Dev Journal — 2025-08-15 — Phase 3: Subscription Gating
-------------------------------------------------------------
Backend:
- Added access.require_active_subscription() to enforce premium access.
- New routers:
  - /v1/predictions/today (protected)
  - /v1/predictions/history (public)
  - /v1/parlay/build (protected), supports American & decimal odds; returns combined odds, payout, profit.
- Updated main.py to register new routers.

Frontend:
- RequireActive component checks /v1/billing/status and shows a Subscribe CTA for inactive users.
- Dashboard rewired to fetch protected /v1/predictions/today.
- Parlay page integrated with /v1/parlay/build.
- Public pages: /track-record and /accuracy (placeholder).

Next steps (Phase 4):
- Introduce DB tables (games, predictions, results, parlays) + migrations.
- Wire predictions today/history endpoints to DB.
- Implement ROI/accuracy endpoint and render charts.
